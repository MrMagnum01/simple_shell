# simple_shell

A simple UNIX command interpreter created as the final project of the low-level programming and algorithm quarter at ALX School of Software Engineering.

## Overview

**Sodashy** is a shell-compatible command language interpreter that executes commands read from the standard input or from a file.

## Invocation

Usage: Sodashy is started with the standard input connected to the terminal. Sodashy can be invoked interactively and non-interactively. If sodashy is invoked with standard input not connected to a terminal, it reads and executes received commands in order.
